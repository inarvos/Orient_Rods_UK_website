    <p>
      (a), (b), and (c) are collectively referred to as &quot;Oliver McCourty
      Properties&quot; or our &quot;Services&quot;. These Terms apply to any
      Site(s) on which they are posted; where other terms or agreements are
      instead posted, those terms or agreements apply to the extent they
      conflict with these Terms. The material, including without limitation
      information, data, text, editorial content, design elements, look and
      feel, formatting, graphics, images, photographs, videos, music, sounds and
      other content contained in or delivered via the Services or otherwise made

      the foregoing categories) that you contribute, provide, post or make
      available using the Services is &quot;Your Content.&quot;
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>1.2 Who&apos;s Who</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      When these Terms use the term &quot;Organiser,&quot; we mean speaking
      event creators using the Services to create speaking events displayed on
      the Services for speakers using our Services (a) to consume information
      about or attend Speaking Events (&quot;Speakers&quot;), or (b) for any
      other reason. Organisers, Speakers and third parties using our Services
      are all referred to in these Terms collectively as &quot;Users,&quot;
      &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your.&quot;
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      When these Terms use the term &quot;Oliver McCourty,&quot; &quot;we,&quot;
      &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our,&quot; that refers to Oliver McCourty Ltd and
      its affiliates, and subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective
      officers, directors, agents, partners and employees. The contracting
      entity on the other side of these Terms is as follows:
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>1.3 What Else</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      If you are an Organiser offering speaking events with paid tickets, Oliver
      McCourty&apos;s Merchant Agreement and Organiser Refund Policy
      Requirements are also applicable to you. If you are an Organiser or
      Speaker, Oliver McCourty&apos;s Community Guidelines are applicable to
      you. (Some, but not all, of the terms in those agreements are duplicated
      in these Terms of Service.) If you are a third party interacting with our
      Services not as an Organiser or a Speaker, the API Terms of Use or
      Trademark and Copyright Policy might be applicable to you. Please be on
      the lookout for additional terms and conditions displayed with certain
      Services that you may use from time to time as those will also be
      applicable to you. And, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you
      acknowledge you have read and you agree to the Privacy Policy and Cookie
      Statement applicable to all Users. We may sometimes provide you with
      services that are not described in these Terms of Service, or customised
      services: unless we have entered into a separate, signed agreement that
      expressly supersedes these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will
      apply to those services as well.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>1.4 What the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; Means</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service and the other documents referenced in them
      (including in Section 1.3 above) comprise Oliver McCourty&apos;s
      &quot;Terms.&quot; These Terms are a legally binding agreement between you
      and Oliver McCourty governing your access to and use of the Services and
      setting out your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services. By
      using any of our Services (including browsing a Site), you are agreeing to
      these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or
      access the Services. If you will be using the Services on behalf of an
      entity (such as on behalf of your employer), you agree to these Terms on
      behalf of that entity and its affiliates and you represent that you have
      the authority to do so. In such case, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;
      will refer to that entity as well as yourself.

    <h3>2. Oliver McCourty&apos;s Services and Role</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>2.1 What We Do</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Oliver McCourty&apos;s Services provide a precise and simple means for
      Speakers to create speaker profiles, Organiser&apos;s to create organiser
      profiles, and other webpages related to their events, promote those pages
      and events to visitors or browsers on the Services or elsewhere online,
      manage online or onsite ticketing and registration, solicit donations, and
      sell or reserve merchandise or accommodations related to those events to
      Speakers or other Users. Descriptions of other and more specific services
      can generally be found on the Site of each of the Oliver McCourty&apos;s
      Properties.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>2.2 How We Fit In</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Oliver McCourty is not the creator, organiser or owner of the events
      listed on the Services. Rather, Oliver McCourty provides its Services,
      which allow Organisers to manage Speakers and for Speakers to manage
      speaking events. The Organiser is solely responsible for ensuring that any
      page displaying an event (and the event itself) meet all applicable local,
      state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations, and
      that the goods and services described on the event page are delivered as
      described and in an accurate satisfactory manner. The Organiser of a paid
      event selects the payment processing method for its event as more fully
      described in the Merchant Agreement. Speakers must use whatever payment
      processing method the Organiser selects. If the Organiser selects a
      payment processing method that uses a third party to process the payment,
      then neither Oliver McCourty nor any of its payment processing partners
      processes the transaction but we transmit the Speaker&apos;s payment
      details to the Organiser&apos;s designated payment provider. If an
      Organiser uses Oliver McCourty Payment Processing (as defined in the
      Merchant Agreement), Oliver McCourty also acts as the Organiser&apos;s
      limited agent solely for the purpose of using our third party payment
      service providers to collect payments made by Speakers on the Services and
      passing such payments to the Organiser.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h2>3-4</h2>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>3. Privacy and Speaker Information</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      3.1 We know your personal information is important to you and it is
      important to Oliver McCourty too. Information provided to Oliver McCourty
      by Users or collected by Oliver McCourty through Oliver McCourty
      Properties, is governed by our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      3.2 If you are an Organiser, you represent, warrant and agree that (a) you
      will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial,
      national and other laws, rules and regulations with respect to information
      you collect from (or receive about) speakers , and (b) you will at all
      times comply with any applicable policies posted on the Services with
      respect to information you collect from (or receive about) speakers.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>4. Term; Termination</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      4.1 These Terms apply to you as soon as you access the Services by any
      means and continue in effect until they are terminated. There may come a
      time where either you or Oliver McCourty decides it&apos;s best to part
      ways as described in Sections 4.2 or 4.3 below. When that happens, these
      Terms will generally no longer apply. However, as described in Section
      4.4, certain provisions will always remain applicable to both you and
      Oliver McCourty.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      4.2 Oliver McCourty may terminate your right to use the Services at any
      time
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>(a) if you violate or breach these Terms;</p>
    <p>
      (b) if you misuse or abuse the Services, or use the Services in a way not
      intended or permitted by Oliver McCourty; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) if allowing you to access and use the Services would violate any
      applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and
      regulations or would expose Oliver McCourty to legal liability.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Oliver McCourty may choose to stop offering the Services, or any
      particular portion of the Service, or modify or replace any aspect of the
      Service, at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with
      notice of our termination of your access to the Services, where, in Oliver
      McCourty's sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice
      you. You agree that Oliver McCourty will not be liable to you or any
      third-party as a result of its termination of your right to use or
      otherwise access the Services.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      4.3 Except to the extent you have agreed otherwise in a separate written
      agreement between you and Oliver McCourty, you may terminate your access
      to the Services and the general applicability of Terms by deleting your
      account. If you are a Speaker using the Services without a registered
      account, your only option for these Terms to no longer apply is to stop
      accessing the Services indefinitely. So long as you continue to access the
      Services, even without an account, these Terms remain in effect. If there
      is a separate agreement between you and Oliver McCourty governing your use
      of the Services and that agreement terminates or expires, these Terms (as
      unmodified by such agreement) will govern your use of the Services after
      such termination or expiration.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      4.4 All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive
      termination of these Terms will survive (including, without limitation,
      all limitations on liability, releases, indemnification obligations,
      disclaimers of warranties, agreements to arbitrate, choices of law and
      judicial forum and intellectual property protections and licences).
    </p>

    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>5. Export Controls and Restricted Countries</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      As a company based in the UK with operations in other countries, Oliver
      McCourty Ltd complies with certain export controls and economic sanctions
      laws. All Users, regardless of your or the event&apos;s location should
      familiarize yourself with these restrictions. In accepting these Terms you
      represent and warrant that:

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      (a) you are not located in, and you are not a national or resident of, any
      country to which the United Kingdom, United States, European Union,
      Australia or Canada has embargoed goods and/or services of the same type
      as the Services, including without limitation, Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
      Syria or the Crimea region of Ukraine; and
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      (b) you are not a person or entity, or owned by, under the control of, or
      affiliated with, a person or entity
    </p>
    <p>

      Specially Designated Nationals List, Foreign Sanctions Evaders List or
      Palestinian Legislative Council List; the U.S. Department of State&apos;s
      Terrorist Exclusion List; the Bureau of Industry and Security&apos;s

    </p>
    <p>ii. that is subject to sanctions in any other country; or</p>
    <p>
      iii. that is engaged in the design, development or production of nuclear,
      biological or chemical weapons, missiles or unmanned aerial vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>6. Release and Indemnification</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      This is where you agree to cover Oliver McCourty if you use the Service in
      a way that causes Oliver McCourty to be the subject of a legal matter, or
      to face other claims or expenses, or as otherwise set forth herein, to the
      extent permitted by applicable laws.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>6.1 Release</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      You hereby agree to release Oliver McCourty from all damages (whether
      direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), losses,
      liabilities, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, known and
      unknown, arising out of a dispute between you and a third party (including
      other Users) in connection with the Services or any event listed on the
      Services. In addition, you waive any applicable law or statute, which
      says, in substance: &quot;A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS
      WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR
      AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE
      MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.&quot;
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>6.2 Indemnification.</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Oliver McCourty and each of its
      and their respective officers, directors, agents, co-branders, licensors,
      payment processing partners, other partners and employees, harmless from
      any and all damage (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or
      otherwise), loss, liability, cost and expense (including, without
      limitation, reasonable attorneys&apos; and accounting fees) resulting from
      any claim, demand, suit, proceeding (whether before an arbitrator, court,
      mediator or otherwise) or investigation made by any third party (each a
      &quot;Claim&quot;) relating to or arising out of:
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      (a) your breach of these Terms (including any terms or agreements or
      policies incorporated into these Terms);
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) your use of the Services in violation of these Terms or other policies
      we post or make available;
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) your breach of any applicable local, state, provincial, national or
      other law, rule or regulation or the rights of any third party;
    </p>
    <p>(d) Oliver McCourty&apos;s collection and remission of taxes; and</p>
    <p>
      (e) if you are an Organiser, your events (including where Oliver McCourty
      has provided Services with respect to those events), provided that in the
      case of (e) this indemnification will not apply to the extent that the
      Claim arises out of Oliver McCourty&apos;s gross negligence or willful
      misconduct.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Oliver McCourty will provide notice to you of any such Claim, provided
      that the failure or delay by Oliver McCourty in providing such notice will
      not limit your obligations hereunder except to the extent you are
      materially prejudiced by such failure. Also, in certain circumstances,
      Oliver McCourty may choose to handle the Claim ourselves, in which case
      you agree to cooperate with Oliver McCourty in any way we request.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h2>7-8</h2>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>7. Disclaimer of Warranties and Assumption of Risks by You</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      We strive to provide Services in the way you need them, but there are some
      things it is important for you to understand that we cannot promise.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Services are provided on
      an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis. Oliver McCourty
      expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, express or implied,
      including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability,
      title, non-infringement and fitness for a particular purpose. For example,
      Oliver McCourty makes no warranty that
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      (a) the Services (or any portion of the Services) will meet your
      requirements or expectations;
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services will be
      accurate or reliable.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that Oliver McCourty has no control over and does not
      guarantee the quality, safety, accuracy or legality of any event or
      Content associated with an event, the truth or accuracy of any information
      provided by Users (including the Speaker&apos;s personal information
      shared with Organisers in connection with events) or the ability of any
      User to perform or actually complete a transaction. Oliver McCourty has no
      responsibility to you for, and hereby disclaims all liability arising
      from, the acts or omissions of any third parties that Oliver McCourty
      requires to provide the Services, that an Organiser chooses to assist with
      an event, or that you choose to contract with when using the Services.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      You understand and agree that some speaking events may carry inherent
      risk, and by participating in those events, you choose to assume those
      risks voluntarily. For example, some events may carry risk of illness,
      bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume
      those risks by choosing to participate in those events.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
      You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily
      required warranties, if any, will be limited to the maximum extent
      permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      8.1 To the extent permitted by applicable laws, or as otherwise set forth
      herein, Oliver McCourty and any person or entity associated with Oliver
      McCourty&apos;s provision of the Services (e.g., an affiliate, vendor,
      strategic partner or employee) (&quot;Associated Parties&quot;), will not
      be liable to you or any third party, for:
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      (a) any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive or
      exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of
      profits, goodwill, use, data, opportunity costs, intangible losses, or the
      cost of substitute services (even if Oliver McCourty has been advised of
      the possibility of such damages); or
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Your Content. In addition, other than the obligation of Oliver
      McCourty to pay out Event Registration Fees in certain circumstances to
      certain organisers under the Merchant Agreement, and only in accordance
      with the terms therein, the maximum aggregate liability of Oliver McCourty
      or Associated Parties is limited to the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      i. for Organisers of events with paid tickets, and subject to the terms of
      the Merchant Agreement, the fees (net of Oliver McCourty Payment
      Processing Fees) that you paid us in the three (3) month period
      immediately preceding the circumstances giving rise to your claim; and
    </p>
    <p>
      ii. for Organisers of events with free tickets only, Speakers or other
      Users, (1) the total amount of all tickets or registrations that you
      purchased or made through the Services in the three (3) month period
      immediately preceding the circumstances giving rise to your claim; or (2)
      if you made no such purchases, one hundred U.S. dollars (US $100).
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      8.2 Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any condition,
      warranty, right or liability which may not be lawfully excluded or
      limited. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
      warranties or conditions or the limitation or exclusion of liability for
      loss or damage caused by willful acts, negligence, breach of contract or
      breach of implied terms, or incidental or consequential damages.
      Accordingly, only those liability and other limitations which are lawful
      in your jurisdiction (if any) will apply to you and our liability is
      limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

      understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed
      the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in
      arbitration than in court.

    <h3>(a) Contact Us First</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      If you have a question or concern about the Services, please contact us
      first. Our customer support team will try to answer your question or
      resolve your concern.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(b) Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve
      your concerns, the parties (you and we) each hereby agree to resolve any
      and all disputes or claims under these Terms, with respect to the
      Services, or related to our relationship through binding arbitration or in
      small claims court (to the extent the claim qualifies) instead of in
      courts of general jurisdiction, and only on an individual basis. In no
      event may either we or you seek to resolve a dispute with the other as
      part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding.
      Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review. Only the arbitrator
      appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local
      court will have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to
      this Section including, without limitation, regarding the scope,
      enforceability and arbitrability of these Terms. This arbitration
      provision will survive termination of these Terms. These Terms evidence a
      transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement
      of this Section 9 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
      notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 9(h) below.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(c) Scope of Agreement</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted as to
      legal disputes between you and us. It includes, but is not limited to: (i)
      all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship
      between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
      misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) all claims that arose
      before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims
      relating to advertising); and (iii) all claims that may arise after
      termination of these Terms and/or your use of the Services.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(d) Exceptions</h3>
    <h3><br /></h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may</p>
    <p>
      (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the
      extent the applicable claim qualifies); or
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising
      from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorised use of intellectual
      property to protect its Intellectual Property Rights (&quot;Intellectual
      Property Rights&quot; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks,
      and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). In addition, the
      portion of any dispute or complaint relating to our participation in the
      US-EU or US-Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks is subject to the Dispute
      Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this
      Section.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(e) No Class Actions</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      YOU AND OLIVER MCCOURTY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
      ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
      MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
      THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&apos;S CLAIMS, MAY
      NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE
      PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
      SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
      WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY&apos;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(f) Notice of Dispute</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a
      written Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to Oliver
      McCourty must be addressed to the following address (&quot;Notice
      Address&quot;) and must be sent by certified mail: Oliver McCourty, Attn:
      Legal Department, 71-75 Shelton Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2H 9JQ.
      Notice to you will be addressed to a mailing, home or payment address
      currently on record with Oliver McCourty and must be sent by certified
      mail. If Oliver McCourty has no records of such physical address, such
      notice may be delivered to your Oliver McCourty account email address. The
      Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and
      (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Oliver McCourty and you do
      not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar
      days after the Notice is received, you or Oliver McCourty may commence an
      arbitration proceeding.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(g) Arbitration Proceedings</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules, or,
      if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal
      or household use of the Services (rather than business use), the Consumer
      Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Section 9, and will be administered
      and settled by a single arbitrator. All issues in dispute between the
      parties are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to,
      issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
      Section 9.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(h) Location of Arbitration Proceedings</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      If you are a Speaker, any arbitration hearings will take place (at your
      option) either in the county of your residence or by phone, except that is
      you are a Speaker whose residence is outside of the United Kingdom, the
      hearing will take place either in London or by phone or videoconference,
      at your option. If you are a business (i.e., your use of the Services were
      for commercial use), then unless Oliver McCourty and you agree otherwise,
      any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient
      location in the United Kingdom for both parties with due consideration of
      their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If your claim
      is for ten thousand pounds (&pound;10,000) or less, we agree that you may
      choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
      documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by
      an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
      manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a
      reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
      conclusions on which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator
      will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be
      entered in any court having jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(i) Costs of Arbitration; Legal Fees</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>i. Payment of Costs and Expenses</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses
      imposed will be governed provided that if you are initiating an
      arbitration against Oliver McCourty and the value of the relief sought is
      ten thousand pounds (&pound;10,000) or less, then Oliver McCourty will
      advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses
      (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). In the event that the
      arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are
      frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to
      reimburse Oliver McCourty for all such cost and expenses that Oliver
      McCourty paid and that you would have been obligated to pay.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>ii. Payment of Legal Fees</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own
      attorneys&apos; fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration. The
      arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement
      of attorneys&apos; fees and expenses upon request from either party made
      within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator&apos;s ruling on the merits.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(j) Future Changes</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and
      Oliver McCourty agree that if Oliver McCourty makes any future change to
      this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address)
      Oliver McCourty will provide you with notice of such change and you may
      reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30)
      calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By
      rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any
      dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as
      unmodified by such rejected change.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(k) Special Severability</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      In the event that any provisions of this Section 9 are found to be invalid
      or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, the entirety of this
      Section 9 will be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim and
      Section 23 will apply in lieu of this Section 9.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>(l) Opt Out</h3>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration or class
      action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email
      address we associate with you as a User) written notice of your decision
      to opt-out to oliver@olivermccourty.com, with the subject line,
      &quot;ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.&quot; The notice must
      be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or your
      agreement to these Terms (whichever is later); otherwise, you will be
      bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those
      paragraphs. Note that if you opt out of these arbitration provisions,
      Oliver McCourty also will not be bound by them.

    <p>
      (b) You and your affiliates will comply, and will ensure that the venues

      (c) You will only request that Oliver McCourty offer tickets to an event

      authority&apos;s authorization of the event, traffic engineering

    <h3>14. Fees and Refunds</h3>
    <h3><br /></h3>
    <h4>14.1 Fees That We Charge</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the Services are free.
      However, we charge fees when you sell or buy paid tickets or
      registrations. These fees may vary based on individual agreements between
      Oliver McCourty and certain Organisers. Organisers ultimately determine
      whether these fees will be passed along to Speakers and shown as
      &quot;Fees&quot; on the applicable event page or absorbed into the ticket
      or registration price and paid by the Organiser out of ticket and
      registration gross proceeds. The fees charged to Speakers may include
      certain other charges, including without limitation, facility fees,
      royalties, taxes, processing fees and fulfillment fees. Therefore, the
      fees paid by Speakers for an event are not necessarily the same as those
      charged by Oliver McCourty to the applicable Organiser or the standard
      fees described on the Services to Organisers. In addition, certain fees
      are meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by Oliver
      McCourty, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some
      cases include an element of loss. Oliver McCourty does not control (and
      thus cannot disclose) fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company,
      including fees for purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign
      currencies or from foreign persons. Be sure to check with your bank or
      credit card company prior to engaging in a transaction to understand all
      applicable fees, credit card surcharges and currency conversion rates.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>14.2 Ticket Transfers</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      If you wish to transfer tickets to an event you have purchased on Oliver
      McCourty, in some instances Oliver McCourty may be able to accommodate
      this for you. In all other instances, please contact the Organiser of the
      event to arrange for ticket transfer. If you are unable to reach the
      Organiser, or the Organiser is unable to arrange a ticket transfer, please
      contact us.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h4>14.3 Refunds</h4>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Because all transactions are between an Organiser and its respective
      attendees, Oliver McCourty asks that all Speakers contact the applicable
      Organiser of their event with any refund requests. You can find help with
      getting a refund here.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      (a) If you are a Speaker, you acknowledge that should you receive a refund
      for your ticket, you will discard any ticket that we or any Organiser has
      delivered, and will not use it (or any copy of it) to attend the event.
      Violation of the foregoing constitutes fraud. You acknowledge that the
      applicable procedure to check the validity of the ticket must always be
      followed. Oliver McCourty will not be held liable under any circumstances
      for any costs arisen from non-compliance by Organisers with applicable
      procedures that must be implemented by Organisers to check validity of
      tickets. Oliver McCourty will not be held liable under any circumstances

      provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. Section titles
      in these Terms are for convenience and have no legal or contractual
      effect. No independent contractor, agency, partnership, joint venture or
      other such relationship is created by these Terms. We may freely assign
      any of our rights and obligations under these Terms. We may translate
