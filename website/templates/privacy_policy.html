<p><strong>2. Our Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Application</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that can
  be associated with or which relates to a person and/or could be used to
  identify a person (&quot;Personal Data&quot;) that is collected from Users on
  or through the Services. This policy also covers personal data collected from
  Oliver McCourty sales customers and prospects. We take the privacy of your
  Personal Data seriously. Because of that, we have created this Privacy Policy.
  Please read this Privacy Policy as it includes important information regarding
  your Personal Data and other information.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  &quot;Non-Personal Data&quot; as used in this Privacy Policy is therefore any
  information that does not relate to a person and/or cannot be used to identify
  a person. When you interact with the Services, we may collect Non-Personal
  Data. The limitations and requirements in this Privacy Policy on our
  collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage/retention of Personal Data
  do not apply to Non-Personal Data.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>3-4</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>3. Personal Data That We Collect</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  When you use or interact with us through the Services or engage with Oliver
  McCourty as a sales customer or prospect, we may collect Personal Data.
  Sometimes this will be on our own behalf and other times this will be on
  behalf of an Organiser using our Services to run an event. This is an
  important distinction for purposes of certain data protection laws and is
  explained in more detail below.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>3.1 Information Collected From All Users</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Information you provide to us: For all Users we collect Personal Data when you
  voluntarily provide such information to the Services, such as when you
  register for access to the Services, contact us with inquiries, respond to one
  of our surveys or browse or use certain parts of the Services. The Personal
  Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email
  address and any other information that you choose to provide and/or that
  enables Users to be personally identified. Information we automatically
  collect: We also automatically collect certain technical data that is sent to
  us from the computer, mobile device and/or browser through which you access
  the Services (&quot;Automatic Data&quot;). Automatic Data, includes without
  limitation, a unique identifier associated with your access device and/or
  browser (including, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address)
  characteristics about your access device and/or browser, statistics on your
  activities on the Services, information about how you came to the Services and
  data collected through Cookies, Pixel Tags, Local Shared Objects, Web Storage
  and other similar technologies. You can find out more information about how we
  use Cookies and other similar tracking technologies in our Cookie Statement.
  When you register for the Services or otherwise submit Personal Data to us, we
  may associate other Non-Personal Data (including Non-Personal Data we collect
  from third parties) with your Personal Data. At such instance, we will treat
  any such combined data as your Personal Data until such time as it can no
  longer be associated with you or used to identify you.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>3.2 Information Collected From Organisers</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you are an Organiser we will collect additional Personal Data from you.
  Information you provide to us: In some cases, we may collect your debit/credit
  card information (e.g., your debit/credit card number and expiration date,
  billing address, etc.), some of which may constitute Personal Data, to secure
  certain payments. In addition, if you use our payment processing services, we
  will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account
  information or an address to send checks) as necessary to facilitate payments
  and information required for tax purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification
  number). Information we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or
  receive Personal Data including your name, email address and other contact
  information from third party sources, such as third party websites and
  marketing partners, your bank, our payment processing partners and credit
  reporting agencies.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>3.3 Information Collected From Speakers</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you are a Speaker we will collect additional Personal Data from you,
  sometimes for our own purposes and other times on behalf of an Organiser (see
  Section 16 below for more information).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Information you provide via Oliver McCourty Properties or Applications: If you
  register for a paid event, you will provide financial information (e.g., your
  credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) some of which
  may constitute Personal Data. In addition, Organisers can set up event
  registration pages to collect virtually any information from Speakers in
  connection with registration for an Organiser&apos;s event listed on the
  Services. Oliver McCourty does not control an Organiser&apos;s registration
  process nor the Personal Data that they collect. When you register for, or
  otherwise provide information to Oliver McCourty in conjunction with an
  Organiser event or activity, whether that information is yours or a third
  party&rsquo;s, in connection with a purchase, registration, or transfer, that
  Organiser will receive and may use the information you provide. Please see
  Section 5.5 below, titled &ldquo;How We Disclose and Transfer Your Personal
  Data: Organisers&rdquo; for more information about an Organiser&rsquo;s
  receipt and use of your Personal Data.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Information we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or receive
  Personal Data from third party sources, such as Organisers, other Speakers,
  social media or other third party integrations, your credit card issuing bank,
  our payment processing partners or other third parties.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Information Collected from Sales Clients and Leads</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you engage with the Oliver McCourty sales team we may collect the
  following: your name, email, address, phone number, and other professional
  contact information. If you engage with the sales team and consent to
  recording a meeting, the sales team may collect audio and/or video recordings
  of you.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We collect and use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent
  with this Privacy Policy, and applicable privacy laws. We may use the Personal
  Data as follows:
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.1 Specific Reason</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal
  Data in connection with the purpose for which it was provided. For instance,
  if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to
  answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email
  address from which the contact came.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.2 Access and Use</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the
  Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to
  provide you with access to or use of the Services or functionality and to
  analyze your use of such Services or functionality. For instance, if you
  supply Personal Data relating to your identity or qualifications to use
  certain portions of the Services, we will use that information to make a
  decision as to granting you access to use such Services and to assess your
  ongoing qualification to use such Services.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.3 Internal Business Purposes</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes, including
  without limitation, to help us improve the content and functionality of the
  Services, to better understand our Users, to improve the Services, to protect
  against, identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Service, to
  manage your account and provide you with customer service, and to generally
  manage the Services and our business.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.4 Oliver McCourty and Organiser Marketing</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may use your Personal Data for our marketing and advertising purposes,
  including (without limitation) by email, SMS marketing, display media, and
  targeting other devices (such as tablets, mobile devices and televisions). We
  do this in order to inform you about services or events we believe might be of
  interest to you, develop promotional or marketing materials and display Oliver
  McCourty or event-related content and advertising on or off the Services that
  we believe might be of interest to you. We may also do this on behalf of an
  Organiser, for example where your prior interactions with an Organiser suggest
  you may be interested in a particular type of event. See &quot;Opt Out from
  Electronic Communications&quot; below on how to opt out of various Oliver
  McCourty marketing communications.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  You may see advertisements for our Services on third party websites, including
  on social media platforms. We also provide Organisers with tools to help them
  display advertisements for their events on third party websites and social
  media platforms. Where you see an advertisement on a third party website or
  social media platform, this may be because we or the Organiser engaged the
  third party or social media platform to show the advertisement to Users, or to
  others who have similar attributes to our Users. In some cases, this involves
  sharing your email address or other contact details with the third party or
  social media platform so that they can identify you as one of our Users, or
  identify other individuals with similar attributes to you in order to show
  them advertisements for our Services (or for our Organiser&rsquo;s events). If
  you no longer want your Personal Data to be used for these purposes please
  contact us at oliver@olivermccourty.com. In the case of an Organiser&rsquo;s
  advertising, you may need to contact the Organiser directly. For more
  information about how we and Organisers market on, and interact with social
  media sites, please refer to section 5.6.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.5 Organiser Emails</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We allow Organisers to use our email tools to contact Speakers for their
  current and past events, so you may receive emails from our system that
  originate with such Organisers and that we send on their behalf. If you
  registered for an event on the Services, your email address is available to
  that Organiser. However, Organisers may also import the email addresses they
  have from external sources and send communications through the Services to
  those email addresses, and we will deliver those communications to those email
  addresses on the Organiser&apos;s behalf. The Organiser and not Oliver
  McCourty is responsible for sending these emails. See &quot;Opt Out from
  Electronic Communications&quot; below on how to opt out of Organiser-initiated
  communications.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.6 Use of Interest-Based Data</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We sometimes make inferences about the type of events or activities you may be
  interested in. We may use these inferences to help target advertising or
  customize recommendations to you, including on behalf of Organisers. We may do
  this on an aggregated or generalized basis. For instance, we may determine
  that our users who attend many comedy events also often attend or show
  interest in endurance-related events or content. We may direct (or assist in
  directing) content or recommendations related to both comedy and endurance to
  those Users.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.7 Other Purposes</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent
  with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior
  to or at the time the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your
  consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>4.8 Aggregated Personal Data</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  In an ongoing effort to understand and serve our Users better, we often
  conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on
  Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research is
  typically conducted on an aggregate basis only that does not identify you.
  Once Personal Data is in an aggregated form, for purposes of this Privacy
  Policy, it becomes Non-Personal Data.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5-6</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5. How We Disclose And Transfer Your Personal Data.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.1 Background</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We are not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this
  information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. Therefore, we
  will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party
  advertisers. There are certain circumstances in which we may disclose,
  transfer or share your Personal Data with certain third parties without
  further notice to you, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.2 Business Transfers</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the
  event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganisation, dissolution or similar
  event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. We may also
  disclose your Personal Data in the course of due diligence for such an event.
  You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Oliver McCourty
  (or its assets) will continue to have the right to use your Personal Data and
  other information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.3 Parent Companies, Subsidiaries and Affiliates</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may also share your Personal Data with our parent companies, subsidiaries
  and/or affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our parent
  companies, subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to maintain that Personal
  Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.4 Agents, Consultants and Service Providers</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may share your Personal Data with our contractors and service providers who
  process Personal Data on behalf of Oliver McCourty to perform certain
  business-related functions. These companies include our marketing agencies,
  online advertising providers, data enhancement and data services providers,
  database service providers, backup and disaster recovery service providers,
  email service providers, payment processing partners, customer support, tech
  support, hosting companies and others. When we engage another company to
  perform such functions, we may provide them with information, including
  Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such functions.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.5 Organisers</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  In addition, when you register for an event, sign up for communications, enter
  a contest, or otherwise input your Personal Data (such as through a web form)
  to communicate with an Organiser or participate in an Organiser event, that
  Organiser will receive that information. For instance, if you input your name
  and email address into a web form for an Organiser offer, activity or event,
  the Organiser will receive that information. The Organiser may then send you
  marketing or other communications, which may be subject to its own, separate
  privacy policy. Likewise, if you provide your mobile phone number, you may
  receive information messages related to the service, event, activity or
  information in which you&rsquo;ve expressed interest.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event, transfer an
  event ticket or registration to another person, enter a contest, or otherwise
  input your Personal Data (such as through a web form), or otherwise
  communicate with an Organiser, or participate in or express interest in an
  Organiser or Organiser event or activity, that Organiser will receive the
  information you provide, including your Personal Data, and where a ticket or
  registration is transferred, the Personal Data of the transferee as well.
  Other third parties that are involved in or on whose behalf an event or
  activity is promoted, may receive that Personal Data as well. For example, as
  to fundraising pages, we may provide your Personal Data both to the Organiser
  charity of the fundraising page and the Organiser of the event to which the
  fundraising page is linked. In some instances, an Organiser may appoint a
  third party, which may or may not be affiliated with the Organiser, to create
  a speaking event or fundraising page on its behalf (we call these third
  parties (&quot;Third Party Organisers&quot;).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For example, and without limitation, a concert venue (the Organiser, in this
  case) may allow third party promoters or production companies (the Third Party
  Organisers) to create events that will be hosted at the Organiser&apos;s venue
  using its Oliver McCourty account. In that case, we may provide your Personal
  Data to the Third Party Organisers on behalf of the Organisers. The same is
  true for contests and sweepstakes: we may provide your Personal Data to both
  the Organiser promoting the contest or sweepstakes, and any legal sponsor of
  the contest or sweepstakes (such as a brand sponsor).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We are not responsible for the actions of these Organisers, or their Third
  Party Organisers (or other downstream recipients of your Personal Data), with
  respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the applicable
  policies of the Organisers, and if applicable and available, their appointed
  Third Party Organisers, of an event (and the related fundraising page, if
  applicable) before providing Personal Data or other information in connection
  with that event or related fundraising page. Similarly, if you are a member of
  an Organiser&apos;s organisation within Oliver McCourty, your Personal Data
  will be available to the Organiser and shared with those Third Party
  Organisers granted permission by the Organiser to view all members of the
  Organiser&apos;s organisation.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.6 Social Media and Other Third Party Connections</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  a. Connecting Your Oliver McCourty Account to Social Media Services. You can
  connect your Oliver McCourty account to your accounts on third party services
  like Facebook, in which case we may collect, use, disclose, transfer and
  store/retain information relating to your account with such third party
  services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you connect
  with Facebook, we store your Facebook id, first name, last name, email,
  location, friends list and profile picture and use them to connect with your
  Facebook account to provide certain functionality on the Services, like
  recommending events that your Facebook friends are interested in and sharing
  the events you are interested in, or attending, with certain groups of people
  like your Facebook friends.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  (b) &ldquo;Liking&rdquo; or &ldquo;Following&rdquo; Oliver McCourty on Social
  Media. In addition, when you &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;follow&rdquo; us on
  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn or other social media sites (to the
  extent we provide that capability), we may collect some information from you
  including your name, email address, and any comments or content you post
  relevant to us. We likewise may collect your information if you sign up for
  one of our promotions or submit information to us through social media sites.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  (c) Facebook Plug-Ins and Links on Our Pages. Oliver McCourty&apos;s own
  website may contain links to Facebook as well, such as through the Facebook
  &ldquo;Like&rdquo; or &ldquo;Share&rdquo; button or other social plug-ins.
  When you interact with these features and links, your browser will establish a
  direct link with the Facebook servers, and Facebook will receive information
  about your browser and activity, and may link it to your Facebook user
  account. For more information about how Facebook uses data, please see
  Facebook&rsquo;s own policies.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  (d) Additional Facebook Marketing and Connectivity by Organisers. In addition,
  if you are a member of Facebook (or another social media platform), and you
  provide Personal Data to an Organiser (such as in the ways described in
  Section 5.5), the Organiser may use that Personal Data to send you advertising
  and offers through Facebook (or another social media) platform, including when
  you are on Facebook or another social media platform. The Organiser may use
  tool that we provide and may also work with third parties to enable this data
  integration and advertising. Facebook and other social media platforms may
  provide a way to opt out of this type of advertising. Please review their user
  settings and support pages to learn more about how they help you to manage
  privacy and marketing choices.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  (e) Third party services and integrations. Oliver McCourty may provide you
  with opportunities to contract directly with third parties, and/or to
  integrate with third party services or applications, through our platform. In
  such instances, we will disclose your Personal Data to other entities in order
  to fulfill a request by you, or to provide services you have requested.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.7 Legal Requirements</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law in order to
  (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a court
  or a government agency (including in response to public authorities to meet
  national security or law enforcement requirements), or in the good faith
  belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation,
  (b) protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third
  parties, (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the
  Services, (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
  Users of the Services or the public, or (e) protect against legal liability.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>6. How We Store Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may store Personal Data itself or such information may be stored by third
  parties to whom we have transferred it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data
  collected via the Services from loss, misuse, unauthorized use, access,
  inadvertent disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no network,
  server, database or Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or
  error free. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what
  information you send to us electronically. Please keep this in mind when
  disclosing any Personal Data.
</p>
<p><br /></p>

  <strong
    >7. How You Can Access, Update, Correct or Delete Your Personal Data</strong
  >
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  You can access or delete your Personal Data stored by us. If you are a
  registered User, you can do this by logging in and visiting the Account
  Settings page to download a copy of your Personal Data in machine readable
  form and/or delete your Personal Data. You can also edit some of your Personal
  Data directly through your account. In certain cases, you can ask us to
  correct and update any inaccurate Personal Data using the contact information
  below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If a Speaker initiates a data deletion request, Oliver McCourty is authorized
  to delete or anonymize Personal Data of the requesting Speaker from the
  Services even if that means removing its availability to the Organiser through
  the Services. However, if you are a Speaker, you understand that even if
  Oliver McCourty deletes or anonymizes your Personal Data upon your request or
  pursuant to this Policy, your Personal Data may still be available in the
  Organiser&apos;s own databases if transmitted to the Organiser prior to Oliver
  MCCourty receiving or taking action on any deletion or anonymization activity.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Unregistered Users and Ticketfly Speakers may also access, update, correct or
  delete Personal Data and exercise these rights using the contact information
  below. We will consider and respond to all requests in accordance with
  applicable law.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>8. How Long We Retain Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may retain your Personal Data as long as you are registered to use the
  Services. You may delete your account by visiting the Account Settings page.
  However, we may retain Personal Data for an additional period as is permitted
  or required under applicable laws. Even if we delete your Personal Data it may
  persist on backup or archival media for an additional period of time for
  legal, tax or regulatory reasons or for legitimate and lawful business
  purposes. For sales customers and prospects, we retain your data as long as we
  maintain a relationship with you and for a limited period of thereafter as
  necessary to meet business and legal requirements.

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>(b) Organiser-initiated Communications</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Organisers may use our email tools to send electronic communications to those
  on their email subscription lists, including Speakers who have registered for
  their speaking events on the Services in the past. Although these electronic
  communications are sent through our system, Oliver McCourty does not determine
  the content or the recipients of these electronic communications. Organisers
  are required to use our email tools only in accordance with all applicable
  laws. Oliver McCourty provides an &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; link on each of
  these emails, which allows recipients to &quot;opt out&quot; of electronic
  communications from the particular Organiser.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>(c) Social Notifications</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you connect your Facebook account or sign up for other social media
  integrations whose product features include social notifications (i.e.,
  updates on what your friends are doing on the Services), you will receive
  these social notifications. You can manage these social notifications by
  toggling your social settings to private or disconnecting such integration.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>(d) Transactional or Responsive Communications</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Certain electronic communications from Oliver McCourty are responsive to your
  requests. For instance, if you are a Speaker, we must email you your ticket or
  registration on behalf of the Organiser when you purchase such ticket or
  registration. As a further example, if you email our customer support
  department, we will return your email. Notwithstanding any unsubscribe
  election that you have made, you will still receive these transactional or
  responsive emails. You can stop receiving these types of emails only by
  contacting us. By electing to stop receiving all electronic communications
  from us or through our system, you will no longer receive any updates on
  events you have created (including payout issues) or on events you are
  registered to attend (including emails with your tickets). We do not recommend
  that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Services, are not
  currently registered for an event, are not currently organising an event, and
  will have no need to receive further communications from us or through our
  system.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>(e) Retention</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  It may take up to forty-eight (48) hours for us to process an unsubscribe
  request. Even after you opt out of all electronic communications, we will
  retain your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we
  will no longer use it to contact you. However, Organisers who have received
  your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may still use that
  Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies,
  but they may not use our system to do so.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>10.3 Do Not Track</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We currently do not participate in any &quot;Do Not Track&quot; frameworks
  that would allow us to respond to signals or other mechanisms from you
  regarding the collection of your Personal Data.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>11-12</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>11. Exclusions</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>11.1 Personal Data Provided to Others</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data that you provide to
  another User or visitor through the Services or through any other means,
  including to Organisers on event pages or information posted by you to any
  public areas of the Services.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>11.2 Third Party Links</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain
  links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (the &quot;Third
  Party Sites&quot;). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply
  to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we
  endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those
  sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>12. Children - Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of
  thirteen (13). If you are under the age of thirteen (13), please do not submit
  any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal
  guardians to monitor their children&apos;s Internet usage and to help enforce
  our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal
  Data through the Services without their permission. If you have reason to
  believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us
  through the Services, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that
  information from our databases.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>13-14</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>13. International Privacy Laws</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you are visiting the Services from outside the United Kingdom, please be
  aware that you are sending information (including Personal Data) to the United
  Kingdom. That information may then be transferred within the United Kingdom or
  back out of the United Kingdom to other countries outside of your country of
  residence, depending on the type of information and how it is stored by us.
  These countries (including the United States) may not necessarily have data
  protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of
  residence; however, our collection, storage and use of your Personal Data will
  at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>14. Changes To This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at
  times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We
  reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update or modify this Privacy
  Policy at any time (collectively, &quot;Modifications&quot;). Modifications to
  this Privacy Policy will be posted to the Site with a change to the
  &quot;Updated&quot; date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In certain
  circumstances Oliver McCourty may, but need not, provide you with additional
  notice of such Modifications, such as via email or with in-Service
  notifications. Modifications will be effective thirty (30) days following the
  &quot;Updated&quot; date or such other date as communicated in any other
  notice to you.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any
  Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was updated on the date indicated above.
  Your continued use of the Services following the effectiveness of any
  Modifications to this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those
  Modifications. If any Modification to this Privacy Policy is not acceptable to
  you, you should cease accessing, browsing and otherwise using the Services.

<p><strong>15-16</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>15. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you have a complaint about Oliver McCourty&apos;s privacy practices you
  should write to us at: Oliver McCourty Ltd, Attn: Privacy Officer, 71-75
  Shelton Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2H 9JQ, or by email
  oliver@olivermccourty.com. We will take reasonable steps to work with you to
  attempt to resolve your complaint. Residents of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK
  who believe that their information has not been processed in compliance with
  the Privacy Shield Principles may raise their complaints in a number of ways.
  For further information, please see our Privacy Shield Notice.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  16. EEA, SWITZERLAND AND UK ONLY The EU General Data Protection Regulation
  (GDPR) requires Oliver McCourty and Organisers using the Service to provide
  Users with more information about the processing of their Personal Data. Here
  is what you need to know:
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we&apos;re relying on
  to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing
  your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section 4 above will typically
  be because:
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>you provided your consent;</p>
<p>it is necessary for our contractual relationship;</p>
<p>
  the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory
  obligations; and/or
</p>
<p>
  the processing is in our legitimate interest as an event organising and
  ticketing platform (for example, to protect the security and integrity of our
  systems and to provide you with customer service, etc.).
</p>
<p>Transfers of Personal Data</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which
  it was originally provided. This may be intra-group or to third parties that
  we work with who may be located in jurisdictions outside the EEA, Switzerland
  and the UK which have no data protection laws or laws that are less strict
  compared with those in Europe.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Whenever we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK,
  we take legally required steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in
  place to protect your Personal Data. This includes the use of Standard
  Contractual Clauses issued pursuant to Commission Implementing Decision (EU)
  2021/914 of June 4, 2021 of the European Parliament and of the Council. You
  can find Oliver McCourty&apos;s pre-signed Standard Contractual Clauses and
  additional information in the Organiser Data Processing Agreement.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Personal Data retention</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide you with our
  Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal
  obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If you have an account with us, we will typically retain your Personal Data
  for a period of ninety (90) days after you have requested that your account is
  closed or if it&apos;s been inactive for seven (7) years.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Your rights</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Data protection law provides you with rights in respect of Personal Data that
  we hold about you, including the right to request a copy of the Personal Data,
  request that we rectify, restrict or delete your Personal Data, object to
  profiling and unsubscribe from marketing communications.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For the most part, you can exercise these rights by logging in and visiting
  the My Profile page or changing the &quot;cookie settings&quot; in your
  browser (see our Cookie Statement for more information). If you can&apos;t
  find what you&apos;re looking for in the My Profile page, please contact us
  using the contact information set out in Section 15 above. Please note that
  requests to exercise data protection rights will be assessed by us on a
  case-by-case basis. There may be circumstances where we are not legally
  required to comply with your request because of the laws in your jurisdiction
  or because of exemptions provided for in data protection legislation. If you
  have a complaint about how we handle your Personal Data, please get in touch
  with us as set forth in Section 15 to explain. If you are not happy with how
  we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data
  protection authority.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>Oliver McCourty as a data controller and a data processor</strong>
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  EU data protection law makes a distinction between organisations that process
  Personal Data for their own purposes (known as &quot;data controllers&quot;)
  and organisations that process personal data on behalf of other organisations
  (known as &quot;data processors&quot;). If you have a question or complaint
  about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to
  the relevant data controller since they are the ones with primary
  responsibility for your Personal Data.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Oliver McCourty may act as either a data controller or a data processor in
  respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For example, if you create an account with us to organise your events, Oliver
  McCourty will be a data controller in respect of the Personal Data that you
  provide as part of your account. We will also be a data controller of the
  Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the Applications or
  Oliver McCourty Properties, which could relate to Organisers or Speakers. We
  use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve
  Users of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with
  more targeted recommendations about events we think may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  However, if you register for an event as a Speaker, we will process your
  Personal Data to help administer that event on behalf of the Organiser (for
  example, sending confirmation, promotional and feedback emails, processing
  payments, etc.) and to help the Organiser target, and understand the success
  of, their event and event planning (for example, providing event reports,
  using analytics to gain insights into the effectiveness of various sales
  channels, etc.). In these circumstances, Oliver McCourty merely provides the
  tools for Organisers; Oliver McCourty does not decide what Personal Data to
  request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued
  accuracy of any Personal Data provided. Any questions that you may have
  relating to your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law
  should therefore be directed to the Organiser as the data controller, not to
  Oliver McCourty.
